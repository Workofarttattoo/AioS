These\nmodels can independently produce high-quality edits for each image in a set of\nmulti-view images of a 3D scene or object, but they do not maintain consistency\nacross views. Existing approaches typically address this by optimizing over\nexplicit 3D representations, but they suffer from a lengthy optimization\nprocess and instability under sparse view",

      "summary": "Identity-consistent generation has become an important focus in text-to-image\nresearch, with recent models achieving notable success in producing images\naligned with a reference identity. Yet, the scarcity of large-scale paired\ndatasets containing multiple images of the same individual forces most\napproaches to adopt reconstruction-based training. This reliance often leads to\na failure mode we term copy-paste, where the model directly replicates the\nreference face rather than preserving identity",
