Location: Europe. Methods: We synthesised existing literature on NCP associated with European terrestrial vertebrates, and leveraged ecological traits and trophic interactions from previously established datasets. We identified 15 NCP (10 regulating NCP and 5 non-material NCP), with 860 species providing at least one NCP (out of 1,168 vertebrate species considered in total). Then, we harnessed species distribution data and a novel European land system map to create species-mediated NCP maps across Europe at a 1km resolution, including societal demand for each NCP. Results: We found that i) for each NCP, at least 25% of NCP provider species are assessed as threatened with extinction; ii) NCP multifunctionality is lowest in high-intensity land systems; and iii) direct exploitation and agricultural intensification are major threats to species-mediated NCP, impacting both non-material and regulating NCP provider species. Main conclusions: Protecting threatened NCP provider species, and reducing direct exploitation are key to maintain regulating and non-material NCP. Our results suggest that de-intensifying agricultural practices, through maintaining heterogeneous mosaic landscapes and promoting diversified practices, could increase NCP multifunctionality.

Upon TCR engagement, we observe a paradoxical increase in whole-cell FRET signal, which immunolabeling reveals to be due to selective internalization of inactive Lck (pY505), while active Lck (pY394) remains membrane-associated and enriched at the immune synapse (IS). Using CD8 mutants that disrupt Lck binding, we demonstrate that free Lck undergoes more pronounced conformational activation than coreceptor-bound Lck. Furthermore, we show that C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) preferentially phosphorylates free Lck at Y505, while CD45 suppresses its activation via dephosphorylation of Y394, suggesting a dual regulatory mechanism that maintains free Lck in an inactive state under resting conditions.

Our findings highlight an immunomodulatory role of GFAP positive astrocytes, which exhibited marked morphological and molecular alterations and adopted a unique intermediate reactive state (A1/A2).

In 21 healthy adults, resting-state EEG data was collected before and after placebo or diazepam, a positive allosteric modulator of type A {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors. The shape of individual cycles in the alpha band was then derived using empirical mode decomposition, followed by extraction of principal components (PCs) describing specific facets of alpha shape.

Ndufs4-/- mice are a widely used animal model to study LS pathophysiology and interventions. These mice display an isolated mitochondrial complex I deficiency and a brain-specific pathomechanism. Similar to other mouse models of human disease, Ndufs4-/- mice are routinely housed and studied at a subthermoneutral ambient temperature. This means that these mice experience chronic cold-stress, which potentially aggravates disease symptoms and reduces their translational value. Here, we provide evidence that housing Ndufs4-/- mice at 26 oC instead of 20 oC increases their skin, core and brain temperature. At this higher temperature, Ndufs4-/- mice displayed lower energy expenditure and, importantly, a longer lifespan, pathology reversal in specific brain regions, as well as increased voluntary locomotor activity. We conclude that ambient temperature is a previously overlooked but highly relevant disease modifier in Ndufs4-/- mice. Given the reduced mitochondrial energy production and aberrant thermoregulation in LSS and other MD patients, our findings suggest that reducing energy requirements might be of therapeutic value and/or contribute to an improved quality of life in these patients.

In insects, internal water balance is regulated through the Malpighian tubules and the hindgut, which transport water and ions across their epithelia under the regulation of multiple peptide hormones. One of these, ion transport peptide (ITP), a member of the highly conserved crustacean hyperglycemic hormone superfamily among ecdysozoans, is an anti-diuretic hormone in insects, but its mechanism of action remains largely unclear. Here, we show that the short amidated isoform of ITP (saITP), secreted from brain neurosecretory cells, regulates water absorption via the receptor guanylyl cyclase (rGC) Gyc76C in the hindgut of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Both ITP and Gyc76C are evolutionarily conserved and are essential for larval survival in D. melanogaster, as mutation or knockdown of either gene results in early larval lethality. In Drosophila S2 cells, synthetic saITP increases intracellular cyclic GMP (cGMP) in a Gyc76C-dependent manner, an effect abolished by deletion of its putative ligand-binding domain. Using the fluorescent cGMP biosensor RedcGull in ex vivo-cultured hindguts, we found that saITP increases epithelial cGMP levels, and this response requires Gyc76C. Consistently, saITP promotes hindgut water reabsorption via Gyc76C. Thus, saITP acts via Gyc76C in a brain-hindgut neuroendocrine axis that regulates internal water balance during development.

Despite correlations between thermal performance traits having been reported in the literature for a few taxa and performance tasks, such as population growth rate, a comprehensive global analysis of the entire tree of life and multiple performance tasks remains an open challenge. To advance in this open question, we compile a database of 1,300 thermal response curves, encompassing 38 variable types related to individuals' performance (including per capita population growth rate, photosynthetic rate, among others) and 1,125 different species, ranging from viruses to mammals, encompassing all major lineages of the tree of life. Our analysis reveals that among all possible relationships between traits and optimal performance, four traits form a line with a high goodness-of-fit, while the remaining traits exhibit a polygonal pattern, either a triangle or a tetrahedron. We derive a thermodynamic framework that explains the relationships described by a curve or line (as opposed to a surface or polygon), highlighting the linear relationship between maximum and minimum temperatures, as well as between maximum and optimum temperatures. We also discuss other generic trait evolution models, which could account for the other significant sublinear relationships, as well as the more general model, Pareto optimality theory, which could account for relationships in the form of lines or polygons. Our theoretical framework and empirical evidence suggest that, based on a single data point (e.g., minimum temperature), all critical temperature limits and maximum performance boundaries can be predicted using the estimated parameter from this study.

Two main conduction mechanisms have been proposed: the hard knock-on, in which ions traverse the selectivity filter in direct contact, and the soft knock-on, which involves co-permeation of water molecules. Using microsecond molecular dynamics simulations with the OPC water model, the AMBER19SB protein force field, and the 12-6-4 Sengupta et al. ion model, we observed that both hard and soft knock-on mechanisms are accessible and, notably, can reversibly transition in the MthK and KcsA channels across all simulated membrane potentials. These reversible transitions contrast with previous observations using the TIP3P water model, where water entry either disrupted conduction or was expelled, favoring exclusive hard knock-on events. Our results suggest that the choice of the water model, force field, and ion parameters significantly influences the observed conduction mechanism. Importantly, the coexistence of hard and soft knock-on in these simulations provides a potential reconciliation between structural data supporting hard knock-on and streaming potential measurements demonstrating water co-permeation.

We show that arginine uptake by SLC38A9 is pH-dependent, and that the histidine residue His544 serves as the pH sensor.

The first depends on bridge-RNA and excises the element via copy-out to form a circular intermediate, revisiting the earlier cut-out model. Integration occurs predominantly through top-strand insertion, suggesting an alternative to the earlier Holliday junction-mediated dual-strand mechanism. The second involves cooperation between a truncated target-binding loop RNA and bridge-RNA, enabling direct top-strand transfer to a new target via two sequential reactions, bypassing circular intermediates. Both pathways preserve the original transposon copy. These findings redefine the mechanistic understanding of IS110 transposition and reconcile prior discrepancies, offering insight into programmable, RNA-guided genome modification.", "published": "", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.25.684509v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.5, "ingested_at": "2025-10-25T20:39:40.933886"}

It involves Pol{delta}-mediated DNA strand displacement synthesis that produces 5' flaps, FEN1-mediated 5' flap cleavage, and LIG1-catalyzed nick ligation. Recently, we discovered that under stress conditions, yeast cells convert 5' flaps into 3' flaps, which are degraded by 3' flap nucleases to produce ligatable DNA nicks. However, little is known about this stress-induced, 3' flap-based OFM in human cells. Here, we report that 3' flaps frequently form in various human cancer cells, and that FEN1 deficiency significantly enhances 3' flap levels. XPF1 is recruited to the replication forks in FEN1 mutant or FEN1-chemically inhibited cells. Notably, XPF deficiency or inhibition in those defective cells leads to accumulation of 3' flaps, replication-related DNA strand breaks, and unique mutation signatures. Furthermore, XPF and FEN1 inhibitors show synergistic effects in killing human cancer cells. In summary, we demonstrate that 3' flap-based OFM is an important alternative of 5' flap-based OFM in mammalian cells. XPF is a key nuclease to degrade 3' flaps and complete OFM for survival. Targeting this compensatory mechanism could provide new therapeutic strategies to selectively impair cancer cell survival under pre-existed replication stress.", "published": "", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.24.684453v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.45, "ingested_at": "2025-10-25T20:39:40.934209"}

This is higher in other African countries including Zambia and Tanzania and nosuch studies have been conducted in endemic areas in the Central Region of Malawi. The study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors for FGS in Nkhotakota district, Central Malawi. Methods The cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2024 to March 2025. Two hundred and sixty women (N=260) of childbearing age accessing healthcare services were consecutively sampled from the selected healthcare facilities. An interviewer-guided questionnaire was used to collect data regarding the demographics and FGS symptoms of the participants. Colposcopy was conducted by an experienced gynecological clinical officer to identify FGS lesions and was supervised by a specialist gynecologist. Data were coded, cleaned, and analyzed using the R software (version 4.3.1). Results The prevalence of FGS using colposcope as a diagnostic tool in women of childbearing age was 32.6%(84/258).

The soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) and placental growth factor (PlGF) ratio shows promise as a diagnostic tool, but its adoption in the U.S. is limited, due to a lack of widely available testing platforms, locally conducted studies based on the U.S. population and clear, evidence-based guidance on test implementation, including appropriate cutoff values. Patients/Materials and Methods: This is a cohort study evaluating the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio for predicting PE within two weeks among pregnant individuals ([&ge;]18 years old, gestational age [&ge;]20 weeks. Serum samples were collected during routine prenatal visits or using leftover samples from triage evaluations. Patients diagnosed with PE before sample collection, those with postpartum samples, or those missing delivery or diagnostic data were excluded. sFlt-1/PlGF ratios were measured using Roche Elecsys assays, and predictive performance was assessed by operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis with logistic regression, bootstrapping, and cross-validation. Results: The sFlt-1/PlGF ratio was significantly higher in hypertensive patients (n = 119) than in non-hypertensive patients (n = 346) (p < 0.001).

Methods: This prospective, longitudinal time-bound study was conducted over three months (August-October 2024) at a tertiary care center in northern India. Adult patients ([&ge;] 18 years) with positive lower respiratory tract samples (aerobic culture or Multiplex PCR (Biofire(R) FilmArray) were enrolled.

The final classification was determined by the investigator. Outcomes, including treatment response and mortality at 28 days, were compared across pathogen and non-pathogen groups. Findings: Of the 145 included cases, 131 (903%) were classified as pathogens and 14 (97%) as non-pathogens. Cohen's Kappa between investigator and microbiologist classifications was 028, indicating fair agreement. Among pathogen cases, 68 (519%) responded to treatment, while 63 (481%) did not respond to treatment in the pathogenic group. In contrast, 12 of 14 non-pathogen cases (857%) were not treated, with favourable outcomes in most, and only one unrelated death (71%). Interpretation: The structured clinico-microbiological model strongly correlates with treatment outcomes, making it useful for differentiating infection from colonization.

We applied the method to age prediction, using linear modelling and whole-body water-fat MRI data of 38,235 subjects (age span = 45 - 82 years) in the multicentre UK Biobank study, resulting in predictions representing morphological age (MA). We observed state-of-the-art whole-body age prediction performance on a held-out test set with a mean absolute error of 1.951/2.057 years, and R2 of 0.884/0.892 for females/males, respectively. The method was observed to outperform both previously reported CNN-based results from the UK Biobank, and predictions from explicit biomarkers, from a multi-organ/tissue segmentation approach, in a direct comparison. The image-based interpretability of the model allowed for detailed and tissue-specific analysis of the utilized body-wide associations with age. Important regions for the predictions included volumes of the aorta, regional muscle, bone marrow, and adipose tissue depots, and lean tissue fat content. The predicted MAs were of clinical relevance as they were significantly related to both type 2 diabetes and all-cause mortality. A key finding was an accuracy/utility trade-off where the more parsimonious models showed lower CA predictive performance but higher clinical relevance and interpretability.

In members without diabetes, while the incidence rates of adverse outcomes were lower, treatment with GLP-1RAs still resulted in lower risk of ESRD (HR=0.66, CI 0.46-0.94), ESLD (HR=0.76, CI 0.62-0.93) and MACE (HR=0.86, CI 92-0.99). Persistent GLP-1RA treatment (>=2 years) in members with diabetes resulted in the largest observed reduction in ESRD, ESLD, and MACE risk. Conclusions: GLP-1RA treatment was associated with reduced incidence of kidney and liver failure and MACE. The impact of GLP-1RA treatment was greatest in members with diabetes and those persisting for >=2 years.", "published": "", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.24.25338256v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.3, "ingested_at": "2025-10-25T20:39:41.121712"}

AKI lasting over 48 hours, known as persistent AKI (pAKI), has much worse outcomes. Hemodynamic optimization is cornerstone of AKI management, however, current strategies rely on bundled care interventions that are inconsistently implemented, underscoring the need for personalized hemodynamic optimization. Objective: To develop and validate a reinforcement learning (RL) model to guide individualized dosing of intravenous (IV) fluids, vasopressors, and inotropes for prevention of pAKI after cardiac surgery. Design: Cohort study. Model development and internal validation were performed retrospectively in MIMICIV, with external validation in SICdb, a European database (retrospective), and then in Mount Sinai Health System cohort using data from Jan 1 to Aug 18, 2025). Setting: Multicenter retrospective cohort study. Participants: Admissions to ICU after cardiac surgery. Exposures: Postoperative hemodynamic management during first 72 hours of ICU stay using IV fluids, vasopressors, and inotropes. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was pAKI within 5 days after surgery. The RL model optimized treatment policies through reward based learning, where higher rewards reflected improved outcome. We assessed model performance relative to clinicians using Fitted Q Evaluation and adjusted weighted pooled logistic regression. Results: There were 6,643 adult ICU admissions following cardiac surgery in MIMICIV, 2,254 in SICdb, and 846 in MSHS. Median age was 70 years in MIMICIV, 70.0 years in SICdb, and 64 years in MSHS cohort with 72%, 73%, and 70% males respectively. AKI occurred in 41.4%, 19.7%, and 22.5% of admissions, with pAKI in 30.5%, 43.0%, and 33.7% of AKI cases, respectively. RL model achieved higher cumulative rewards than clinicians across all cohorts. Concordance between clinician actions and recommendations of RL model was associated with lower adjusted odds of pAKI (OR, 0.92 [0.89 to 0.96] in SICdb; 0.91 [0.86 to 0.96] in MSHS). RL model favored smaller IV fluid volumes, moderate vasopressor dosing, and greater inotrope use. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, personalization of early postoperative hemodynamic management using an RL model was associated with decreased risk of pAKI. These findings suggest that AI guided hemodynamic strategies may enhance postoperative care after cardiac surgery.", "published": "", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.23.25338698v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.3, "ingested_at": "2025-10-25T20:39:41.121928"}

N."], "abstract": "Importance: In 2025, the United States experienced the largest number of measles cases since its elimination in 2000. These outbreaks require extensive public health responses to mitigate, consume substantial hospital resources, and impose an economic and financial burden on state and federal budgets. Objective: To review evidence on the costs of measles outbreaks in the United States between 2000 and 2025, as well as to examine how costs scale with outbreak size to better model the costs associated with measles outbreaks. Evidence Review: We conducted a literature review using PubMed to identify studies published between January 1, 2000, and October 7, 2025, using terms related to measles cases, costs, and outbreak response, across all 50 states in the United States of America. Additional publicly available reports beyond the PubMed published literature were identified through a review of official CDC and state health department reports. Findings: A total of 120 articles were screened, 33 underwent full text review, and data were extracted from 19 articles, yielding outbreak relevant costs in 18 different states. Eight additional reports in the gray literature were identified. Outbreak size ranged from 1 to 802 cases. Average outbreak cost per case was estimated at $43,203.65, while the average cost per contact was $443.46. Average cost per case varied from $33,415.75 from the medical provider perspective to $58,591.50 when including public health response costs. The incremental cost per case was estimated at $16,197.13 per additional measles case, after accounting for the fixed costs of initiating a public health response. Conclusion and Relevance: Measles outbreaks in the U.S. continue to re-emerge and impose significant financial and public health burden. These outbreaks are largely preventable through inexpensive and highly effective measles vaccination paired with system-level preparedness for effective containment. Since fixed response costs for any outbreak can be costly, our estimates provide improved data on how costs of measles outbreaks scale with outbreak size by isolating incremental costs associated incident new cases, as well as incident contacts, for use alongside budgetary planning and modeled risk assessments.", "published": "", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.24.25338724v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.3, "ingested_at": "2025-10-25T20:39:41.122176"}

In Somalia, the prevalence of NTDs is fueled by limited access to clean water, inadequate sanitation, and insufficient healthcare infrastructure, which disproportionately affect vulnerable groups such as women, children, and rural populations. Prolonged political instability has further impeded efforts to conduct research and establish effective surveillance systems for NTDs. Unlike its neighboring countries, Somalia lacks a comprehensive master plan for NTD prioritization. This scoping review mapped the existing research on NTDs in Somalia, identified knowledge gaps, and proposed future research and policy priorities. We included 36 studies published between January 1968 and July 2025, which reported eight neglected tropical diseases, with visceral leishmaniasis (38.9%) and schistosomiasis (33.4%) being the most studied. Other diseases, such as soil-transmitted helminthiases, chikungunya, rabies, and mycetoma, remain severely under-researched. Despite being a WHO priority country for leprosy, only two studies on this disease were identified. The studies predominantly used descriptive designs, with 52.8% led by authors outside Somalia, highlighting gaps in local research capacity. The review underscores the urgent need for systematic epidemiological studies, enhanced surveillance systems, and integration of NTD research into Somalias health policies. Addressing these gaps requires building local research infrastructure, promoting community-based interventions, and fostering collaborations between the government, Somali researchers, and international organizations. This evidence-based approach is vital to mitigating the burden of NTDs and improving health outcomes for Somalia's underserved populations.", "published": "", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.23.25338432v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.3, "ingested_at": "2025-10-25T20:39:41.122535"}

A combined approach covering 12% of current PWID, all detained ex-PWID, and 13% of former PWID in the community would nearly eliminate HCV infections among PWID, reducing infections to 0.3% (95% CrI: 0.25% - 0.45%) of ever-PWID 30 years after treatment initiation. Interpretation Eliminating HCV infections among PWID is achievable but costly, particularly when targeting all PWID regardless of incarceration. Treating detained PWID offers a more feasible and cost-effective alternative.

A cross-sectional survey revealed that 89% of households depend on tap water, yet 78% express significant concerns about its safety, prompting inconsistent treatment practices (45% treat water \"seldom\"). Physicochemical analysis of tap water samples identified critical contamination issues: 33.3% of samples exceeded Bangladesh (BD ECR 2023) iron (Fe) limits (0.3-2.05 mg/L), while 100% surpassed WHO guidelines (0.3 mg/L). Manganese (Mn) exceeded permissible levels (0.1 mg/L) in 33.3% of samples. Total coliform contamination (up to 12 CFU/100ml) was widespread, though fecal coliforms were absent. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) attributed 82.22% of water quality variance to dissolved solids (electrical conductivity, salinity) and metal contamination (Fe, Mn), linked to geogenic/anthropogenic sources. Health risk assessments revealed non-carcinogenic hazards, particularly for children, with Hazard Index (HI) values reaching 2.87-far exceeding the safety threshold (HI > 1). Iron posed the greatest risk (THQ up to 2.44 for children), underscoring vulnerabilities due to physiological sensitivity. Despite 67% of respondents reporting satisfaction with water quality, stark disparities exist between perception and analytical results, driven by aesthetic/metallic concerns.

This study aimed to investigate this relationship and to evaluate the potential mediating role of depression symptoms. Methods: This longitudinal study included 6,113 middle-aged and older adults with CKM syndrome (stages 0-3) from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). Cumulative ACE scores (total, intrafamilial, social) were derived from a life history survey. Incident CVD was determined during follow-up (2013-2018). Cox proportional hazards models assessed ACE-CVD associations, with restricted cubic splines evaluating dose-response relationships. Counterfactual-based mediation analysis quantified the contribution of depression symptoms (CES-D [&ge;]10). Results: During follow-up, 931 incident CVD cases occurred. A graded, positive association was observed between cumulative ACE exposure and CVD risk. In fully adjusted models, compared to the low ACE group (0-2), participants in medium (3-4) and high ( [&ge;]5) ACE groups had significantly increased CVD risks (HR=1.22, 95% CI: 1.05-1.41; HR=1.29, 95% CI: 1.07-1.55, respectively). Each 1-point increase in the total ACE score was associated with a 7% elevated CVD risk (HR=1.07, 95% CI: 1.03-1.10). Intrafamilial ACEs demonstrated a stronger association (HR=1.08 per point, 95% CI: 1.04-1.13) than social ACEs. A nonlinear dose-response relationship was identified (P for nonlinearity <0.001). Depression symptoms significantly mediated 14.26% (95% CI: 4.56%-24.17%) of the total ACE-CVD association, with varying proportions observed for intrafamilial (15.92%) and social (32.47%) ACE subtypes. Conclusions: Among Chinese adults with CKM syndrome stages 0-3, cumulative ACE exposure, particularly intrafamilial adversities, is independently associated with an increased risk of incident CVD in a dose-response manner. Depression symptoms partially mediate this association.

This study quantifies the contribution of depressive symptoms to self-rated health and assesses cross-national variation in this association. Methods: Using general population data from older adults (age 55 years+) in 18 countries in the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE, 2011-2015), we employed four approaches: (1) country-specific pseudo R-square models assessing the contribution of depressive symptoms (EURO-D) to SRH, adjusting for socio-demographics, physical health, and functional limitations; (2) partial correlation networks to visualize relationships between SRH, depressive symptoms, and physical health indicators; (3) Blinder-Oaxaca decompositions to quantify cross-country differences in SRH attributable to depressive symptoms and (4) stratification of the estimates by gender. Results: Depressive symptoms explained nearly as much variance in SRH as physical health. Partial correlation networks revealed SRH as central to all health measures, and correlations with depressive symptoms ranging from 0.15 (Israel) to 0.35 (Hungary). Decomposition analyses identified three distinct patterns: Nordic countries (e.g., Denmark, Sweden) had lower depression prevalence but stronger depression-SRH associations, Eastern European countries (e.g., Estonia, Hungary) showed lower depression levels but weaker depression-SRH associations, and Mediterranean countries (e.g., Greece, Spain) exhibited higher depressive symptoms prevalence but weaker depression-SRH associations. Gender disparities in SRH were largely explained by differences in depressive symptom levels rather than differential weighting of depressive symptoms in self-assessments. Discussion: Depressive symptoms contribute to self-rated health independently of physical health, confirming that mental health is integral to how individuals perceive their health.

To resolve these conflicting findings, we analyzed genomic and clinical data from 800,160 participants with genetic sequencing and medical records across the Vanderbilt BioVU, NIH AllofUs, and UK Biobank. Stroke events were identified and classified as ischemic or hemorrhagic using ICD codes. Results from the three cohorts were meta-analyzed with previously published results.

This study examined how auditory and somatosensory feedback influence vocal motor control and adaptation in individuals with and without pMTD. Method: Fifty-one participants (pMTD: n = 10; controls: n = 41) completed a 200-trial altered auditory feedback (AAF) paradigm involving sustained vowel productions with fundamental frequency (f0) downward shifts at -100 cents. The task was repeated with nebulized lidocaine to transiently attenuate laryngeal somatosensory input. Data were analyzed to extract the magnitude and direction of vocal adjustments across baseline, ramp, hold, and washout phases. Results: Vocally healthy controls demonstrated robust adaptive vocal response to f feedback alterations followed by an adaptive after-effect during the washout phase, particularly when somatosensation was intact. In contrast, when somatosensation was intact, individuals with pMTD displayed exaggerated overshooting vocal responses in f0, lacked typical after-effect adaptation, and showed greater variability overall. Notably, somatosensory disruption stabilized adaptation in pMTD with nebulized lidocaine. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that pMTD is characterized by maladaptive reliance on somatosensory input that interferes with normal auditory-motor integration. While vocally healthy speakers use somatosensory cues to stabilize vocal control, in pMTD these cues may act as a source of instability. The results underscore the need for therapeutic approaches targeting sensory-motor integration, including individualized interventions that recalibrate the balance between auditory and somatosensory feedback. This study reframes pMTD as a multisensory integration disorder and opens new directions for mechanism-driven voice therapy.", "published": "", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.23.25338678v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.3, "ingested_at": "2025-10-25T20:39:41.125926"}

This has led to the development of absorbable bone cements that address many of the limitations of PMMA. Often, visualization of absorbable bone cements is challenging because their radiopacity closely resembles that of vertebral bone. This study aims to improve the radiopacity of absorbable bone cements through the addition of gadolinium nanoparticles (GdNP). In addition, we aim to determine whether photon counting computed tomography (PCCT), which has been shown to have enhanced image quality when compared with conventional CT, provides better contrast ratio between GdNP-loaded bone cement and vertebral bone than energy-integrating detector CT (EID-CT). Finally, we aim to evaluate if PCCT can successfully quantify the concentration of GdNPs through imaging. Materials and Methods: GdNPs were synthesized using a one-pot thermal decomposition method and characterized using transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. Hydroxyapatite-based bone cement was loaded with varying concentrations of GdNPs (0-10 % w/w), and the contrast ratio between the cement and vertebral bone was evaluated using preclinical EID-CT and PCCT scanners. Gadolinium standards (0-20 mg/mL) were imaged using a preclinical PCCT. Attenuation of the cement was measured in each PCCT energy bin, and the concentration of the gadolinium was estimated using gadolinium material decomposition images. Results: The synthesized GdNPs had a mean diameter of 15.42 {+/-} 1.82 nm. Signal intensity increased with increasing concentration of GdNPs for both EID-CT and PCCT. In EID-CT images, the 8% and 10% GdNP-loaded bone cement had higher contrast ratios relative to bone than the conventional bone cement (p < 0.01). The contrast ratio between the 10% GdNP-loaded bone cement significantly differed from that of conventional bone cement for all PCCT energy bins (p < 0.05). The 42- 51 keV energy bin yielded the most significant difference between 10% GdNP-loaded bone cement and bone cement with no GdNP loading. Contrast ratios obtained from PCCT images differed significantly from EID-CT contrast ratios (p < 0.0001). Estimated gadolinium concentrations were highly correlated with true gadolinium concentrations (r = 0.999). PCCT was able to accurately quantify gadolinium concentrations with a root mean square error of 1.60 mg/mL. Conclusions: The use of GdNPs led to a higher cement-vertebra contrast ratio for both EID-CT and PCCT. Overall, PCCT demonstrated higher contrast ratios than EID-CT. Material decomposition successfully quantified the amount of gadolinium present in samples and allowed for improved visual differentiation of the GdNP-loaded bone cement from the calcium-based vertebral bodies. Thus, the incorporation of radiopaque GdNPs and imaging with PCCT improved visualization of the bone cement and enabled GdNP quantification, which may lead to improved implant monitoring.", "published": "", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.23.25338635v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.3, "ingested_at": "2025-10-25T20:39:41.126551"}

Activated S6K1 acts through multiple effectors, including programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), to activate mRNA translation and protein synthesis. Much of what is known about PDCD4 is in non-muscle cells. We previously demonstrated that the effect of PDCD4 differs between myoblasts and myotubes. Here, we showed that PDCD4 depletion in L6 and C2C12 myotubes enhanced myotube diameter (+36%) and accumulation of myofibrillar proteins (+163 to 237%). These effects occurred along with increased phosphorylation of AKTser473 (+85%) and of the mTORC1 substrate S6K1thr389 (+152%), but protein synthesis was suppressed.

In starved myotubes treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins was attenuated in PDCD4-depleted cells. PDCD4 depletion did not augment measures of myotube contraction but was associated with reduced ATP and intracellular amino acid levels.

Using a conditioned punishment task in male and female rats, we replicate findings of a bimodal distribution of punishment avoidance, and identify four distinct behavioural phenotypes (Sensitive, Hypersensitive, Insensitive, Generalised) that differed in their punishment avoidance, unpunished reward-seeking, and Pavlovian fear. We examined how these phenotypic differences related to c-Fos (transcriptional activity marker) across prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions. While region-level c-Fos differences were minimal, covariance and graph-theoretic analyses revealed three functional PFC networks predominantly composed of medial PFC, ventrolateral PFC, or sensorimotor regions. Activity in the ventrolateral PFC network predicted punishment avoidance, while activity in the medial PFC network predicted generalised suppression during initial punishment learning. These findings suggest phenotypic differences in punishment sensitivity is underpinned by differential recruitment of distinct cortical networks that drive adaptive versus maladaptive responses to negative outcomes.", "published": "", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.24.684296v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.4, "ingested_at": "2025-10-25T21:19:43.516841"}

However, an alternative perspective, drawing from ecological psychology and embodied cognition, suggests that perception, decision, and action are interconnected in a cycle. Perception is an active process where information is gathered from the environment through actions that sample task stimuli. The sampling behavior of an animal reflects its internal state and serves as inputs that influence the decision-making process. To examine this framework, we trained rats on a visual stimulus detection task with three luminance levels. Our findings indicated that the time rats spent actively sampling the stimuli correlated with their success in detection, regardless of the cue's luminance. Drift Diffusion Models (DDMs) showed that cue luminance primarily affected the rate of evidence accumulation (drift rate), while active sampling specifically influenced the decision threshold. These results suggest that perceptual decisions are reliant on active cue sampling, supporting the notion that actions and decisions are co-regulated. We also identified significant sex differences: female rats spent more time sampling the cues than male rats. Additionally, males took longer to act after making errors, possibly due to less efficient sampling behavior. These performance differences were linked to negative influences of sampling time on drift rates in females, but not in males. This divergence in the relationship between active sampling and DDM parameters is further support for a sex difference in choice impulsivity.", "published": "", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.25.684539v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.5, "ingested_at": "2025-10-26T16:32:32.307779"}

We evaluate two established multicellular models, the coupled Cha-Noma model of the mouse {beta}-cell network, and the Riz human model. Prior work with these two models suggest that the Cha-Noma model involves minimal intrinsic heterogeneity and therefore bursts with highly synchronized activity, whereas heterogeneity in the Riz model prescribed from in vitro patch-clamp results in highly unsynchronized behavior of the coupled network. We hypothesize that adjusting the number of bursting cells in both model formulations may invoke more physiologically realistic network coordination. We applied a categorical sensitivity analysis to establish which parameters are most important for determining bursting in single cells of the Riz model.

We evaluated the utility of alternate calibration equations and the incorporation of occupancy-based informative priors for improving breeding origin assignments. Specifically, we analyzed feather isotope data from hatch-year semipalmated sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) captured at staging sites in the Canadian Maritimes, as well as known-origin Arctic samples, to compare calibration equations from different reference datasets and test priors derived from eBird habitat occupancy predictions. We demonstrate that Arctic samples of known origin largely align with calibration equations based on broad passerine datasets, although incorporating Arctic samples into the calibration may correct for a marginal westward bias in origin estimates. Using occupancy-based priors that reflect habitat preferences increased precision by 18.8%, identifying hotspots within otherwise expansive isotopic bands. We highlight the validity of existing reference datasets with broad geographic coverage and demonstrate the value of informative priors to refine origin estimates.

The gH/gL heterodimer activates the gB fusion protein, triggering its refolding from a prefusion to a postfusion form to drive membrane merger. The cytoplasmic tail domain (CTD) of gB is proposed to act as an inhibitory clamp that stabilizes the prefusion state, with interactions between gH and gB CTDs destabilizing this clamp. We previously found that herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and saimiriine herpesvirus 1 (SaHV-1) gB homologs are functionally interchangeable but mediate reduced fusion when coexpressed with heterotypic gH/gL. To map the regions of gB responsible for species-specific interactions, we generated HSV-1/SaHV-1 gB chimeras by swapping ectodomain, membrane-proximal region (MPR), transmembrane domain (TMD), and CTD segments. Our results show that homotypic CTD interactions alone are insufficient to trigger fusion, suggesting that gH/gL contacts the ectodomain of gB. We show that the HSV-1 gB CTD is hyperfusogenic relative to the SaHV-1 CTD, whereas the HSV-1 MPR is hypofusogenic relative to the SaHV-1 MPR.

This condition profoundly affects the quality of life and reproductive health of nearly 200 million women of reproductive age worldwide and poses significant clinical challenges due to lack of diagnosis tools and effective treatment. Peritoneal macrophages play a central role in promoting the initiation and progression of EMS. Bioinformatics studies have indicated that the STimulator of INterferon Gene (STING) was downregulated in the macrophages in EMS, and this influenced their polarization and functional. However, the specific contribution of STING pathway alterations to EMS pathogenesis remains unclear. Methods: We integrated scRNA-seq data from EMS patients and healthy controls-including lesions, eutopic endometrium, non-lesional tissue, and peritoneal fluid from EMS patients and healthy controls(n = 19,291 total samples)-to analyze macrophage STING expression and function. Mouse EMS model was generated by injecting uterus fragments into WT or STING-/- mice. Peritoneal fluid was collected and macrophage proportions and subtypes were assessed via flow cytometry. Macrophages were depleted in STING-/- mice prior to EMS induction to evaluate their role in disease progression. In vitro, hemin was used to treat macrophages to investigate how heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) modulates the STING pathway, assessed through immunoblotting, co-immunoprecipitation, ELISA, and multiplex immunofluorescence. Results: Bioinformatic analysis revealed that macrophages within the EMS lesions are primarily derived from peritoneal macrophages and exhibit decreased STING expression, which correlated negatively with HO-1. STING-/- mice developed more numerous and larger EMS lesions, accompanied by a decreased proportion of large peritoneal macrophages and an increase in small peritoneal macrophages. A marked elevation in M2-type macrophages within the lesions was detected in STING-/- mice. In vitro, hemin-induced HO-1 suppressed STING pathway activation in macrophages. Mechanistically, HO-1 inhibited the translocation of STING from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, thereby suppressing STING signaling and facilitating EMS. Conclusion: Macrophages are essential for lesion formation in STING-/- mice. In vitro, hemin promotes EMS progression via HO-1-mediated suppression of the STING pathway.

These channels are modulated by multiple agents and are known binding sites for neuroactive steroids (NAS) including allopregnanolone (AlloP). Using erastin, an agent that promotes VDAC activation by preventing inhibition by tubulin, we assessed the impact of VDAC activation on hippocampal function. Brief erastin administration had no effect on basal transmission but completely inhibited induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the Schaffer collateral pathway of rat hippocampal slices. This LTP inhibition was prevented by VBIT-4, an agent that inhibits VDAC oligomerization. VDAC-mediated LTP inhibition was also prevented by inhibitors of the NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1, downstream effectors of VDACs, but not by inhibition of cGAS-STING, narrowing the neuroinflammatory pathways involved. Similarly, effects of erastin were prevented by AlloP and at lower concentrations by its unnatural enantiomer (ent-AlloP), an agent that unlike AlloP has little effect on GABAA receptors. Erastin also inhibited memory formation in a hippocampal-dependent form of one-trial learning and these effects were prevented by VBIT-4 and ent-AlloP, but not by a non-sedating dose of AlloP. These results have relevance for understanding the role of VDACs as mediators of neuronal stress and for the further development of NAS as neurotherapeutics and modulators of cellular stress.", "published": "", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.24.684242v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.4, "ingested_at": "2025-10-26T16:32:32.310384"}

Here, we used overexpression of the two reprogramming factors SOX2 and cMYC to generate iNSC from erythroid progenitors of donors ranging from neonatal to 101 years of age. Using an epigenetic clock algorithm, we corroborated our previous finding that iNSCs generated from aged donors show pronounced epigenetic de-aging, preserving around 13 % and 5 % of the original donor age at low and high passages, respectively. Studying the dynamic of epigenetic de-aging during iNSC conversion across time, we found that this process is largely protracted, continuing for several weeks and even beyond forced neuronal differentiation of iNSCs. Transcriptomic differences between young and old donor-derived iNSCs dissipate with extended time in conversion, too. Concordant with this observation, established iNSC lines lack age-associated cellular hallmarks, similar to induced pluripotent stem cells and their derivatives. Interestingly, time course analysis of DNA methylation and RNA sequencing data revealed that acquisition of a bona fide NSC signature extends greatly beyond the time point when proliferative PAX6-positive iNSCs emerge.

Does retinotopic cortex represent visual information in an allocentric or retinocentric reference frame? Here, we investigate which reference frame the brain uses by dissociating allocentric and retinocentric reference frames via a head tilt manipulation combined with electroencephalography (EEG). Nineteen participants completed between 1728-2880 trials during which they briefly viewed (150 ms) and then remembered (1500 ms) a randomly oriented target grating. In interleaved blocks of trials, the participant's head was either kept upright, or tilted by 45 degee using a custom rotating chinrest. The target orientation could be decoded throughout the trial (using both voltage and alpha-band signals) when training and testing within head-upright blocks, and within head-tilted blocks. Importantly, we directly addressed the question of reference frames via cross-generalized decoding: If target orientations are represented in a retinocentric reference frame, a decoder trained on head-upright trials would predict a 45 degree offset in decoded orientation when tested on head-tilted trials (after all, a vertical building becomes diagonal on the retina after head tilt). Conversely, if target representations are allocentric and anchored to the real world, no such offset should be observed. Our analyses reveal that from the earliest stages of perceptual processing all the way throughout the delay, orientations are represented in between an allocentric and retinocentric reference frame.

S."], "abstract": "Introduction: Endovascular rescue treatment, including intra-arterial spasmolysis and/or transluminal balloon angioplasty, is widely used for symptomatic vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), yet its impact on functional recovery remains uncertain. We systematically reviewed and synthesized evidence on patient-centered outcomes, exploring effects by follow-up time, intervention type, and clinical severity. Materials and methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science (January 2000-December 2024; final update July 2025). Prospective and retrospective studies of adult aSAH patients receiving endovascular treatment for symptomatic angiographic vasospasm were included. Data extraction followed a standardized PICO framework, and study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Because reporting of angiographic resolution and DCI-related infarction was sparse or inconsistent, quantitative synthesis focused on dichotomized favorable functional outcome (e.g., mRS 0-2 or GOS good recovery). Single-arm meta-analyses of proportions were performed on the logit scale using random-effects generalized linear mixed models, with subgrouping by follow-up, intervention, and clinical severity. Results: Thirty-nine studies (1,627 patients; 27 retrospective cohorts, 5 prospective cohorts, 5 case series, 2 randomized trials) met inclusion criteria; 38 contributed to meta-analysis. The pooled proportion of favorable functional outcomes was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.50-0.61) with substantial heterogeneity (I2 {approx} 71%). Prespecified subgroup analyses by follow-up duration, intervention type, and baseline severity did not reveal significant differences. The two randomized trials reported conflicting short-term results with limited follow-up. Safety reporting was variable but generally acceptable for pharmacologic spasmolysis, while higher complication rates were sometimes observed with mechanical interventions. Conclusion: Among patients with symptomatic vasospasm or DCI requiring endovascular rescue, approximately half achieve a favorable functional outcome. However, marked heterogeneity and reliance on largely observational data preclude firm conclusions regarding comparative effectiveness. Standardized multicenter randomized trials with harmonized definitions of eligibility, timing, outcomes, and adverse events are needed to clarify the therapeutic role and optimize patient selection for endovascular rescue after aSAH.", "published": "", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.23.25338701v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.3, "ingested_at": "2025-10-26T16:32:32.428226"}

Despite the global rise of armed conflict, evidence on effective approaches to building social cohesion in conflict-affected contexts is limited. This study evaluates the activities of a women-led community center on social cohesion among Lebanese and Syrian women in Lebanon, a country characterized by multiple displacement crises and deep sectarian divides. Methods: Following an extensive recruitment drive in neighborhoods surrounding the community center, 206 women were randomized into an intervention and control group. The intervention group was invited to participate in seven sessions of training and structured dialogue facilitated by women volunteers at the center. A total of 177 women across the two groups completed both a baseline and endline survey capturing dimensions of social cohesion including trust, belonging and friendship networks, as well as civic engagement, wellbeing and self-efficacy. We present descriptive analysis of participants baseline characteristics, intervention take-up and social cohesion measures. We then conduct an intent-to-treat analysis of the interventions impact using regression models. Results: Among women assigned to the intervention group, 70 (76.1%) attended any of the sessions. The intervention had a positive effect on participants sense of belonging, measured by the social relationship scale, and civic engagement attitudes and behaviors. We did not find effects on generalized trust or the other outcome measures.   Conclusions: This pilot randomized trial demonstrates the potential of community centers to foster aspects of social cohesion in fragile settings as well as the limitations of short, low-intensity contact interventions. The results emphasize the need for further investment in and evaluation of sustained, contextually adapted approaches. The study also shows that randomized evaluations of community-based initiatives are feasible in conflict-affected contexts and can generate valuable evidence to inform peacebuilding efforts.", "published": "", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.23.25338663v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.3, "ingested_at": "2025-10-26T16:32:32.428570"}

To directly assess this, we used a genetic approach to generate pigmented mice deficient for both Abca4 and Cfd, an essential serine protease for alternative pathway initiation and amplification. Complement protein analysis revealed increased total C3 immunolabeling in the RPE and choroid of Cfd-/- mice, while C3d deposition at the RPE basal labyrinth and apical microvilli was markedly reduced, consistent with impaired alternative pathway activity. Western blotting confirmed altered C3 fragment profiles in Cfd-/- backgrounds, supporting a constitutive role for the alternative pathway in RPE complement activation. However, loss of Cfd did not prevent lipofuscin accumulation in the RPE of Abca4-/- mice. Under light-induced stress, we unexpectedly observed a modest attenuation of outer nuclear layer thinning in Abca4-/- that was unchanged by Cfd loss, which independently also showed a comparable rescuing effect. Together, these findings demonstrate that while the alternative pathway is a major driver of complement activation in the RPE and contributes only modestly to photoreceptor degeneration under light stress, its inhibition is insufficient to alter lipofuscin accumulation in pigmented Abca4-/- mice.", "published": "", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.25.684461v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.6500000000000001, "ingested_at": "2025-10-26T16:42:33.021021"}

Bonded social partners (pair-bonded mates and direct kin) engaged in these dyadic events more frequently and coordinated their visits, as shown by shorter dyadic arrival latencies. Bonded partners also showed higher social tolerance, with feeding individuals benefitting from increased food intake when their partner was present, while queuing individuals accepted short-term opportunity costs to remain with them.

Data collected included demographic information such as age, gender, year of study, and DASS-21 scores. Descriptive statistics were used to determine the prevalence and severity of anxiety, depression, and stress. Binary logistic regression models were employed to identify associations between mental health outcomes and demographics. Differences were statistically significant at a level of 5%. Ethics was obtained prior to data collection. Results: Four hundred and seventy-four students from 11 universities participated in this study, aged 17 to 42 years (mean {+/-} SD: 23 {+/-} 3 years). Most participants were females (n=259, 54.6%), not-married (n=446, 94.1%), Christians (n=297, 62.7%), and had no children (n=451, 95.1%).

K., Regan, S."], "abstract": "Background: Deciduous woody perennials, such as hazelnut, undergo winter dormancy to protect sensitive tissues, such as flowers, from harsh conditions. The reproductive success of the tree is dependent on the release of dormancy under favorable conditions. To bloom, the tree must first experience a certain amount of chilling, followed by a certain amount of warmth. With global warming, many trees risk not being able to accumulate enough chilling to release dormancy. Also, when trees accustomed to warm climates are brought into cold climates, they might bloom prematurely at the first sign of spring, and risk freezing damage. The latter is the case for hazelnut, recently adopted as a crop in Ontario, Canada. The present study investigates the hormonal regulation of dormancy in hazelnut male flowers (catkins) by generating hormone profiles in early and late-blooming accessions throughout the dormant season. Abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellin (GA), auxin, cytokinin (CTK), their metabolites, as well as the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), were measured. Results: ABA decreased with dormancy progression, while GA increased. This correlation implies ABA is primarily responsible for dormancy maintenance in catkins and GA works antagonistically to ABA. Indeed, the ABA/GA ratio steadily decreased throughout dormancy. For the first time, CTKs have been reported to steadily increase during dormancy. Auxin and ethylene appear to primarily play a role in the onset of dormancy. Interestingly, early blooming accessions failed to accumulate the auxin conjugate, IAA-Asp and had higher ACC levels throughout most of dormancy.

Given that large and small cells differ in their biochemical composition, we hypothesize that they should also differ in how they respond to signals and make decisions. Here, we investigated how cell size affects the susceptibility to cell death. We found that large cells are more resistant to ferroptosis induced by system xc- inhibition. Ferroptosis is a type of cell death characterized by the iron-dependent accumulation of toxic lipid peroxides. This process is opposed by cysteine-dependent lipid peroxide detoxification mechanisms. We found that larger cells exhibit higher concentrations of the cysteine-containing metabolite glutathione and lower concentrations of membrane lipid peroxides, compared to smaller cells. Mechanistically, this can be explained by the fact that larger cells had lower concentrations of an enzyme that enriches cellular membranes with peroxidation-prone polyunsaturated fatty acids, ACSL4, and increased concentrations of the iron-chelating protein ferritin and the glutathione-producing enzymes glutamate-cysteine ligase and glutathione synthetase.

It is not known if cells can distinguish different signaling molecules under transient exposure. Here, we explored the temporal limits of signal detection by single macrophages. Microfluidic experiments monitoring NF-kB dynamics showed that macrophages strongly respond even to 1-second pulses of cytokine and pathogen ligands. Information theory showed that short-pulse response is highly specific to the stimulating ligand, comparable to that under long-term stimulation. Macrophages were mainly sensitive to the duration of cytokines, and the dose of pathogen ligands. Stimulus duration altered the ranking of response strengths among different pathogenic ligands. Mathematical modeling showed that receptor cooperativity is crucial for robust responses to transient signals, while receptor pathway variability leads to accurate signaling in fluctuating environments. These findings demonstrate that dynamic transcription factor specificity is preserved across varying signal durations and uncover network-level mechanisms that accurately distinguish transiently encountered threats.", "published": "", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.26.684377v1?rss=1", "relevance_score": 0.45, "ingested_at": "2025-10-26T18:11:52.150460"}

Garner"], "abstract": "Linear-attention models that compress the entire input sequence into a\nfixed-size recurrent state offer an efficient alternative to Transformers, but\ntheir finite memory induces forgetfulness that harms retrieval-intensive tasks.\nTo mitigate the issue, we explore a series of hybrid models that restore direct\naccess to past tokens. We interleave token mixers with intermediate time and\nspace complexity between linear and full attention, including sparse attention\nwith token eviction, and the query-aware native sparse attention. Particularly,\nwe propose a novel learnable token eviction approach. Combined with\nsliding-window attention, an end-to-end trainable lightweight CNN aggregates\ninformation from both past and future adjacent tokens to adaptively retain a\nlimited set of critical KV-pairs per head, maintaining linear attention's\nconstant time and space complexity. Efficient Triton kernels for the sparse\nattention mechanisms are provided.

Although extensively\nstudied in both statistics and probability, key challenges remain: their high\ncomputational cost - addressed partly through incomplete U-statistics - and\ntheir non-standard asymptotic behavior in the degenerate case, which typically\nrequires resampling methods for hypothesis testing. This paper presents a novel\nperspective on U-statistics, grounded in hypergraph theory and combinatorial\ndesigns. Our approach bypasses the traditional Hoeffding decomposition, the\nmain analytical tool in this literature but one highly sensitive to degeneracy.\nBy characterizing the dependence structure of a U-statistic, we derive a\nBerry-Esseen bound valid for incomplete U-statistics of deterministic designs,\nyielding conditions under which Gaussian limiting distributions can be\nestablished even in degenerate cases and when the order diverges. We also\nintroduce efficient algorithms to construct incomplete U-statistics of\nequireplicate designs, a subclass of deterministic designs that, in certain\ncases, achieve minimum variance. Finally, we apply our framework to\nkernel-based tests that use Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and Hilbert-Schmidt\nIndependence Criterion.

We\naddress this gap by developing a principled framework for assessing the\nstatistical significance of most influential sets.
