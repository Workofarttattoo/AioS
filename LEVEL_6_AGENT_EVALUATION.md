- **Protocol Optimization**: Discover optimal protocol configurations
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual network behavior

**Risks:**
- Network changes can break connectivity
- Critical infrastructure component

**Recommendation:** ⚠️ **PARTIAL CONVERT** - Level-6 for analysis only

### Low Priority for Level-6 Conversion

#### 6. **KernelAgent** → Level-4 Max
**Reasoning:**
- Kernel operations are too critical for full autonomy
- Mistakes could crash the entire system
- Benefits don't outweigh risks

**Recommendation:** ❌ **DO NOT CONVERT** - Keep at Level-3

#### 7. **StorageAgent** → Level-4 Max
**Reasoning:**
- Data integrity is paramount
- Autonomous file operations too risky
- Current implementation is sufficient

**Recommendation:** ❌ **DO NOT CONVERT** - Keep at Level-3

#### 8. **UserAgent** → Level-3 Max
**Reasoning:**
- User authentication must remain deterministic
- Privacy concerns with autonomous user profiling
- Security implications too severe

**Recommendation:** ❌ **DO NOT CONVERT** - Keep at Level-2

#### 9. **GuiAgent** → Level-3 Max
**Reasoning:**
- UI changes should be user-driven
- Limited benefit from autonomy
- User experience consistency important

**Recommendation:** ❌ **DO NOT CONVERT** - Keep at Level-2

        "Protect user data",
        "Maintain security",
        "Optimize performance",
        "Reduce costs"
    ]

    PROHIBITED_ACTIONS = [
        "Delete user data",
        "Disable security features",
        "Exceed budget limits",
        "Modify kernel without approval",
        "Share sensitive information"
    ]

    SAFETY_THRESHOLDS = {
        "max_resource_usage": 0.8,
        "max_cost_per_hour": 10.0,
        "min_stability_score": 0.95,
        "max_change_rate": 0.1
    }
```

### Monitoring Requirements

- **Cost Overruns**: Exploration leads to unexpected expenses
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Agent discovers but doesn't report issues
- **Alignment Drift**: Goals diverge from human intent over time

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Gradual Rollout**: Start with one agent, expand slowly
2. **Sandboxing**: Test in isolated environments first
3. **Budget Controls**: Hard limits on spending

## Conclusion

Converting select Ai|oS meta-agents to Level-6 autonomy offers significant benefits in terms of performance, predictive capability, and cost optimization. However, the conversion must be selective and carefully controlled.

The recommended approach - converting OrchestrationAgent, SecurityAgent, and ScalabilityAgent while keeping critical system agents at lower autonomy levels - balances innovation with safety.

With proper constitutional constraints, monitoring, and gradual rollout, Level-6 agents can transform Ai|oS into a truly self-optimizing system while maintaining alignment with human values and safety requirements.

## Next Steps
