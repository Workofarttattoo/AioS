# Product Brief: AgentaOS (AI:OS)

## Vision
AgentaOS is the next-generation agentic operating system, designed to orchestrate complex workloads, manage system resources autonomously, and provide a secure foundation for AI-driven applications. It transcends traditional OS boundaries by integrating intelligent meta-agents directly into the kernel, security, and networking layers.

## Problem Statement
Current operating systems are static and reactive. Managing distributed systems, container orchestration, and security often requires disparate tools and manual intervention. AI researchers and security professionals need a unified platform that can:
- **Autonomously detect and mitigate threats.**
- **Dynamically scale resources based on intent.**
- **Orchestrate complex multi-agent workflows seamlessly.**

## Solution
AgentaOS introduces a declarative, manifest-driven runtime where "Meta-Agents" are first-class citizens. These agents oversee critical system functions:
- **Kernel Agent**: Intelligent process scheduling and resource allocation.
- **Security Agent**: Proactive threat detection and sovereign security toolkit.
- **Scalability Agent**: Automated provisioning of containers and VMs.

## Target Audience
- **DevOps Engineers**: For autonomous infrastructure management.
- **Security Analysts**: For the integrated Sovereign Security Toolkit.
- **AI Researchers**: As a platform for testing multi-agent systems.

## Key Differentiators
- **Manifest-Driven**: Everything is configuration-as-code.
- **Agentic Core**: Intelligence is baked into the OS runtime.
- **Sovereign Security**: Includes a full suite of offensive and defensive tools (AuroraScan, CipherSpear).
- **Virtualization Native**: Seamless QEMU/Libvirt integration for sandboxed execution.

## Success Metrics
- **Adoption**: Number of active installations/deployments.
- **Stability**: Uptime of the agent runtime.
- **Security**: Time-to-mitigate for detected anomalies.
- **Efficiency**: Resource utilization optimization by the Kernel Agent.
