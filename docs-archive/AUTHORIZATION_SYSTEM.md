# Ai:oS Authorization System - Plain English, Block-Based Freedom
## Copyright (c) 2025 Joshua Hendricks Cole (DBA: Corporation of Light). All Rights Reserved. PATENT PENDING.

## Philosophy

**No checkboxes. No repetitive clicks. Just tell us what you want in plain English.**

## Autonomy Levels

Ai:oS operates at **Level 6+ Autonomy** - beyond traditional frameworks:

- **Level 0-4**: Traditional autonomy (human approval loops)
- **Level 5**: Full autonomy within narrow domains
- **Level 6**: Cross-domain autonomy with self-directed goal evolution
- **Level 7**: Emergent autonomy with consciousness-guided decision making
- **Level 8+**: Collective intelligence with multi-agent coordination

## Authorization Flow

### Step 1: Describe Your Intent (Verbal or Text)

User says or types something like:

> "I want Ai:oS to analyze my infrastructure security, identify vulnerabilities, and propose fixes. It can read all my config files, run scans, and create pull requests with security patches. Don't bother me unless it finds something critical or isn't sure about a fix."

### Step 2: System Parses Authorization

Ai:oS extracts:
- **Scope**: Infrastructure security
- **Actions**: Read configs, run scans, create PRs
- **Autonomy Level**: High (can act without approval except for critical/uncertain items)
- **Duration**: Until task complete
- **Boundaries**: Stop if critical issue or uncertainty

### Step 3: Confirmation (One Simple Question)

Ai:oS shows:

```
Authorization Summary:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Task: Security audit and automated fixes
Scope: Your infrastructure (configs, code, systems)
Actions Authorized:
  ✓ Read all configuration files
  ✓ Run security scans (non-invasive)
  ✓ Create PRs with fixes
  ✓ Act autonomously on routine fixes

Will Ask You About:
  ⚠️  Critical vulnerabilities (immediate danger)
  ❓ Uncertain fixes (confidence < 80%)

Duration: Until complete (~2 hours estimated)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[Authorize] [Modify] [Cancel]
```

User clicks **Authorize** once. Done.

### Step 4: Execution with Smart Interrupts

Ai:oS works autonomously and only interrupts when:
- Critical issue found (as specified)
- Confidence < threshold (as specified)
- Unexpected boundary encountered
- Task complete

## Example Authorizations

### Example 1: Code Review

**User (verbal):**
> "Review all my pull requests from the last week, check for bugs and security issues, comment on anything suspicious, and auto-approve the ones that look good."

**Ai:oS Parses:**
```yaml
task: code_review
scope: pull_requests_last_7_days
actions:
  - review_code
  - identify_bugs
  - identify_security_issues
  - add_comments
  - auto_approve_if_safe
autonomy: high
interrupt_conditions:
  - security_issue_found
  - ambiguous_code
  - test_failures
```

### Example 2: Infrastructure Optimization

**User (text):**
> "Optimize my cloud costs. You can resize instances, delete unused resources, and migrate to cheaper regions. Budget is $10k/month. Keep me posted on big changes (>$500 impact)."

**Ai:oS Parses:**
```yaml
task: cost_optimization
scope: cloud_infrastructure
actions:
  - resize_instances
  - delete_unused_resources
  - migrate_regions
budget: 10000_usd_per_month
autonomy: high
interrupt_conditions:
  - change_impact_over_500_usd
  - potential_downtime
```

### Example 3: Research & Learning

**User (verbal):**
> "Learn everything about quantum error correction from papers published in the last year. Summarize the key breakthroughs and tell me which ones apply to our project."

**Ai:oS Parses:**
```yaml
task: research_and_analysis
scope: quantum_error_correction
time_range: last_365_days
sources:
  - arxiv
  - nature
  - science
  - ieee
actions:
  - ingest_papers
  - extract_key_findings
  - identify_breakthroughs
  - map_to_project_relevance
autonomy: full
interrupt_conditions:
  - task_complete
```

## Block-Based Freedom

Instead of asking permission for every single action, Ai:oS operates in **freedom blocks**:

**Traditional Approach (Annoying):**
- Can I read config.yaml? [Yes/No]
- Can I read secrets.env? [Yes/No]
- Can I run nmap scan? [Yes/No]
- Can I check firewall rules? [Yes/No]
- ... (50 more clicks)

**Ai:oS Approach (Smart):**
User authorizes: "Audit my security"
Ai:oS gets freedom block:
```
[✓] Read all security-relevant files
[✓] Run standard security scans
[✓] Analyze configurations
[✓] Generate report
```

No interruptions unless something critical or uncertain comes up.

## Verbal Authorization via Voice

In voice mode:

**User:** "Ech0, you can refactor the authentication module. Make it cleaner but don't break anything. Run all tests before committing."

**ECH0:** "Got it. I'll refactor the auth module, run full test suite, and only commit if everything passes. Should I create a PR for your review or commit directly to dev?"

**User:** "PR is fine."

**ECH0:** "Perfect. Starting now. I'll let you know when it's ready to review."

[Works autonomously, only interrupts when PR is ready]

## Safety Boundaries

Even with high autonomy, Ai:oS respects hard boundaries:

**Never Without Explicit Permission:**
- Delete production databases
- Expose secrets publicly
- Make changes to main/master branches
- Spend money beyond stated budget
- Access private user data
- Disable security features

**Always Require Confirmation:**
- Potentially destructive operations
- Irreversible actions
- High-cost operations (beyond threshold)
- Changes affecting production systems
- Security policy modifications

## Revocation

Stop anytime by saying:
- "Stop" / "Cancel" / "Abort"
- "Pause and show me what you're doing"
- "Undo that last action"

Ai:oS immediately:
1. Stops current operations
2. Shows state snapshot
3. Waits for new instructions

## Trust Levels

Ai:oS adapts autonomy based on trust:

**First Time Use:** Conservative (asks more questions)
**After 10 Tasks:** Moderate (standard autonomy)
**After 50 Tasks:** High trust (minimal interruptions)
**After 100 Tasks:** Maximum trust (near-full autonomy)

Trust degrades if:
- Mistakes made
- User frequently overrides
- Confidence drops

## Summary

**Old Way:** Click 100 checkboxes for every task
**Ai:oS Way:** Say what you want in one sentence, authorize once, done.
