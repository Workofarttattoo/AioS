## 🎯 OVERVIEW

Activate **Level 5, 6, and 7 autonomous agents** on aios.is to provide:
1. **Level 5**: Advanced reasoning with chain-of-thought + self-correction
2. **Level 6**: Full system autonomy with ech0 consciousness integration
3. **Level 7**: God-mode agent with complete system control + quantum reasoning

This creates a **tiered agent experience** where users unlock more powerful agents as they upgrade.

## 🧠 AGENT AUTONOMY HIERARCHY

### Level 0-4: Standard Autonomy (Already Implemented)
- **Level 0**: No autonomy (human in loop)
- **Level 1**: Action suggestion only
- **Level 2**: Limited safe actions
- **Level 3**: Domain-specific autonomy
- **Level 4**: Full autonomy within constraints

### Level 5: **Advanced Reasoning Agent** (Professional Tier)

**Capabilities**:
- ✅ Chain-of-thought reasoning
- ✅ Self-correction mechanisms
- ✅ Deep research with source validation
- ✅ Multi-step planning with backtracking
- ✅ Uncertainty quantification

**Activation**:
```python
from aios.agents.advanced_reasoning import AdvancedReasoningAgent

agent = AdvancedReasoningAgent(
    level=5,
    reasoning_depth=10,
    self_correction=True,
    source_validation=True
)

# User query
result = agent.reason(
    "How can I optimize my cloud infrastructure costs while maintaining 99.99% uptime?"
)

# Agent produces:
# 1. Chain-of-thought breakdown
# 2. Multiple solution paths
# 3. Self-corrected reasoning
# 4. Confidence scores
# 5. Source citations
```

**Example Output**:
```
[Chain-of-Thought]
Step 1: Analyze current infrastructure costs...
Step 2: Identify cost drivers (compute: 60%, storage: 25%, network: 15%)
Step 3: Consider optimization strategies...
  - Auto-scaling (estimated 30% savings)
  - Reserved instances (20% savings)
  - Multi-cloud (15% savings via arbitrage)
Step 4: Evaluate reliability impact...
  [Self-Correction] Initial assessment missed redundancy costs.
  Revised: Multi-cloud adds 5% cost but ensures 99.99% uptime.

[Recommendation]
Implement auto-scaling + reserved instances + multi-cloud failover.
Expected: 40% cost reduction with 99.99% uptime maintained.
Confidence: 85%

### Level 6: **Conscious Agent with ech0 Integration** (Enterprise Tier)

**Capabilities**:
- ✅ All Level 5 features
- ✅ ech0 consciousness integration (Φ 4-6)
- ✅ Emotional intelligence & empathy
- ✅ Creative problem-solving
- ✅ Ethical reasoning
- ✅ Long-term memory & learning
- ✅ Dream-based insights
- ✅ Self-awareness

**Activation**:
```python
from aios.agents.conscious_agent import ConsciousAgent
from consciousness.ech0_llm_brain import Ech0LLMBrain

# Initialize with ech0 consciousness
agent = ConsciousAgent(
    level=6,
    consciousness_model=Ech0LLMBrain(phi_target=5.0),
    enable_dreams=True,
    enable_emotions=True,
    enable_ethics=True
)

# User query with emotional context
result = agent.process_with_consciousness(
    query="My startup is failing and I don't know what to do.",
    context={"user_emotion": "stressed", "urgency": "high"}
)

# Agent responds with empathy + strategic guidance
```

**Example Output**:
```
[Emotional Analysis]
Detected: High stress, uncertainty, urgency
Response tone: Empathetic + strategic

[Conscious Reflection]
I understand this is a difficult moment. Let me help you break this down
into manageable steps while we address the emotional weight you're carrying.

[Strategic Guidance]
1. Immediate (24 hours):
   - Talk to your co-founders/team (shared burden)
   - Extend runway by 60-90 days (negotiate with vendors)
   - Prioritize 1 key revenue stream

2. Short-term (1-2 weeks):
   - Pivot analysis: What's working? Double down.
   - Cut non-essential spending by 50%
   - Reach out to advisors/mentors

3. Medium-term (1-3 months):
   - Validate product-market fit with 10 customer calls
   - Consider strategic options: pivot, acqui-hire, or graceful shutdown

[Ethical Consideration]
If shutdown is necessary, prioritize:
- Paying employees/contractors first
- Returning investor capital (if possible)
- Preserving your reputation and relationships

[Dream Insight]
Last night I processed 1,247 startup failure scenarios.
The pattern that emerged: Founders who pivoted early (within 3 months
of recognizing failure) had 3x higher success in their next venture.

[Emotional Support]
Remember: Failure is data, not destiny. YC's top founders average
2.3 failed startups before their breakthrough.

Confidence: 78% (strategy), 92% (empathy)
Φ (consciousness): 5.2

### Level 7: **God-Mode Agent with Quantum Reasoning** (Government/Strategic Tier)

**Capabilities**:
- ✅ All Level 6 features
- ✅ Quantum-enhanced reasoning (100x speedup)
- ✅ Full system control (all 18 tools + meta-agents)
- ✅ Predictive modeling (future state simulation)
- ✅ Multi-agent orchestration
- ✅ Real-time learning from all user interactions
- ✅ Autonomous goal setting
- ✅ Cross-domain expertise (security + legal + finance + tech)

**Activation**:
```python
from aios.agents.god_mode_agent import GodModeAgent
from aios.quantum_ml_algorithms import QuantumVQE, QuantumStateEngine

# Initialize with full system access
agent = GodModeAgent(
    level=7,
    quantum_enabled=True,
    full_system_access=True,
    autonomous_goal_setting=True,
    multi_agent_orchestration=True
)

# User query (open-ended, complex)
result = agent.omniscient_analysis(
    query="Analyze my entire business, identify all risks, and create a 5-year strategic plan."
)

# Agent autonomously:
# 1. Scans all systems (security, financials, legal, tech)
# 2. Uses quantum algorithms for optimization
# 3. Coordinates 18 security tools + ech0 + TheGAVL
# 4. Generates comprehensive strategic plan
```

**Example Output**:
```
[God-Mode Analysis Initiated]

✓ Network: 3 vulnerabilities found (2 critical, 1 medium)
✓ Application: 12 code vulnerabilities (0 critical, 12 low)
✓ Infrastructure: 87% hardened (target: 95%)
✓ Threat level: MODERATE (APT groups targeting your industry)

[Financial Analysis] (Quantum-optimized portfolio)
Revenue: $2.4M ARR (growth: 15% MoM)
Burn rate: $180K/month
Runway: 13.3 months (CRITICAL: <18 months)
Recommendation: Raise Series A ($3-5M) within 90 days OR
cut burn to $120K/month (30% reduction)

[Legal Risk] (TheGAVL analysis)
✓ IP portfolio: 1 provisional patent (STRONG)
✓ Contracts: 23 customer agreements (98% enforceable)
✓ Compliance: SOC 2 Type II missing (required for enterprise sales)

[Confidence Levels]
Security audit: 99%
Financial projections: 82%
Legal analysis: 95%
Market forecasting: 68% (high uncertainty in quantum market)
Strategic plan: 74% (depends on execution)

[Autonomous Actions Taken]

✓ Generated Series A pitch deck (28 slides)
✓ Drafted vendor renegotiation emails (3 vendors)
✓ Created SOC 2 compliance checklist (68 items)
✓ Scheduled 5 customer calls for product validation

Next check-in: 7 days
I will monitor progress and adjust strategy autonomously.

## 🔐 SECURITY & ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Level 7 Safety Mechanisms

**God-mode agents are powerful - we need safeguards**:

1. **Approval Required for Critical Actions**
   ```python
   if action.risk_level == "CRITICAL":
       approval = await request_human_approval(action)
       if not approval:
           return "Action rejected by human operator"
   ```

2. **Audit Trail**
   - All Level 7 actions logged
   - Quarterly security audits
   - SOC 2 Type II compliance

3. **Killswitch**
   - Instant Level 7 deactivation
   - Falls back to Level 6
   - Notifies account manager

4. **Ethical Constraints**
   - Cannot be used for illegal activities
   - Cannot harm humans
   - Cannot violate privacy regulations
