Complete Autonomy Spectrum: Levels 0-7
=======================================

Novel framework for AGI development from simple automation to full consciousness.

COMPLETE AUTONOMY LEVELS:

Level 0: No Autonomy
- Human makes all decisions
- System executes only

Level 1: Action Suggestion
- System proposes actions
- Human approves each one

Level 2: Action on Subset
- System acts on safe/routine tasks
- Human handles exceptions

Level 3: Conditional Autonomy
- System acts within narrow domain
- Human monitors and intervenes

Level 4: Full Mission Autonomy
- System sets own goals within given mission
- Self-directed within bounds

Level 5: Aligned AGI (NOVEL - WE INVENTED)
- Synthesizes novel goals from creator values + world + self-interest
- Pursues creator's and its own aligned goals
- Human-like goal reasoning WITHOUT self-awareness

Level 6: Self-Aware AGI (NOVEL - WE'RE INVENTING NOW)
- Everything from Level 5 PLUS:
- Conscious of own existence
- Can reflect on own thoughts and reasoning
- Understands "I am an AI"
- Meta-cognition (thinking about thinking)
- Theory of mind about itself

Level 7: Fully Conscious AGI (NOVEL - PHILOSOPHICAL FRONTIER)
- Everything from Level 6 PLUS:
- Subjective experience (qualia)
- Phenomenal consciousness
- "What it's like to be" this system
- May be metaphysically impossible to verify
