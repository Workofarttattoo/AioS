## Integration Architecture

### Boot Sequence

```
1. ai_os.initialize
2. openagi.initialize_memory          ← Load persisted knowledge
   ├─ Load ~/.aios/workflows/...
   └─ Initialize memory manager
3. kernel.* (rest of kernel startup)
...
(continued with other subsystems)
...
Shutdown:
1. openagi.memory_analytics          ← Report learning progress
2. openagi.persist_memory            ← Save to disk
3. orchestration.* (rest of shutdown)
```

### Data Flow

```
Agent Task → Memory Check → Workflow Cache → Execution
                                                 ↓
                                         Tool Discovery
                                                 ↓
                                         Record Results
                                                 ↓
                                         Update Metrics
                                                 ↓
                                         Register Concepts

## Key Code Examples

### Workflow Recording & Retrieval

```python
from aios.openagi_memory_integration import OpenAGIMemoryIntegration

memory = OpenAGIMemoryIntegration()

# Record workflow
memory.record_workflow_execution(
    task="Find restaurants",
    workflow=[{"message": "Search", "tool_use": ["google_search"]}],
    success=True,
    latency=2.5,
    tokens_used=150
)

# Retrieve cached
workflow = memory.get_recommended_workflow("Find restaurants")
```

### Tool Discovery & Learning

```python
from aios.openagi_autonomous_discovery import AutonomousToolDiscovery, ToolCategory

discovery = AutonomousToolDiscovery()

# Register tools
discovery.register_tool("google_search", ToolCategory.SEARCH)
discovery.register_tool("api_call", ToolCategory.INTEGRATION)

# Track usage
discovery.update_tool_effectiveness("google_search", success=True, latency=0.5)

# Get recommendations
top_tools = discovery.get_tool_recommendations()  # ['google_search', ...]

# Predict success
success_rate, reason = discovery.predict_combination_success(["google_search", "api_call"])
```

### Concept Registration

```python
# Register learned concepts from autonomous discovery
memory.register_learned_concept(
    concept="advanced_search_optimal",
    category="tools",
    confidence=0.92,
    source="autonomous_discovery",
    metadata={"effectiveness": 0.92, "success_rate": 0.95}
)

# Query high-confidence concepts
concepts = memory.get_high_confidence_concepts(threshold=0.85)
```
