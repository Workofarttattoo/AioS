## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Import
```python
from aios.openagi_kernel_bridge import OpenAGIKernelBridge
from aios.workflow_memory_manager import WorkflowMemoryManager
```

### Step 2: Initialize
```python
bridge = OpenAGIKernelBridge(
    llm_core=kernel.llm_core,
    context_manager=kernel.context_manager,
    memory_manager=kernel.memory_manager,
    tool_manager=kernel.tool_manager
)
memory = WorkflowMemoryManager()
```

### Step 3: Generate Workflow
```python
workflow = await bridge.generate_workflow(
    task="Find Italian restaurants in Tokyo",
    ctx=execution_context
)
```

### Step 4: Execute
```python
result = await bridge.execute_workflow(
    task="Find Italian restaurants in Tokyo",
    ctx=execution_context,
    workflow=workflow
)
```

### Step 5: Learn
```python
memory.add_workflow_execution(
    task_hash=memory.hash_task(task),
    workflow=workflow,
    success=result.success,
    latency=result.payload['total_latency']
)
```

result = await bridge.execute_workflow(task, ctx, workflow)
print(f"Success: {result.success}, Latency: {result.payload['total_latency']}s")

# Record execution for learning
memory.add_workflow_execution(

## Troubleshooting Quick Guide

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| "Invalid JSON" | LLM not following format | Lower temperature, more retries |
| "Tool not found" | Name mismatch | Check `tool_manager.list_available_tools()` |
| "High latency" | Sequential execution | Use `ToolExecutionMode.PARALLEL` |
| "Low cache hit" | Task descriptions vary | Normalize task descriptions |
| "Memory growing" | Cache accumulation | Call `clear_old_patterns()` daily |

---

## Decision Tree

### When to Use ReAct Workflows

```
Is task multi-step?
  ├─ No → Use direct LLM call
  └─ Yes → Continue

Will task repeat?
  ├─ No → Use workflow once
  └─ Yes → Cache workflow

Need transparency?
  ├─ No → Use workflow internally
  └─ Yes → Show workflow for approval

Parallel tools available?
  ├─ No → Use sequential mode
  └─ Yes → Use parallel mode
```

### Tool Execution Mode Selection

```
Task Type                        | Mode
Fast decisions (< 1 tool)       | SEQUENTIAL
API calls / searches            | PARALLEL
Code execution / file ops       | SEQUENTIAL
Mixed workload                  | HYBRID (default)
Latency critical                | PARALLEL
Consistency critical            | SEQUENTIAL
```

---

## Metrics Dashboard

```python
# Get real-time stats
stats = bridge.get_execution_stats()
print(f"""
  Executions: {stats['total_executions']}
  Success rate: {stats['success_rate']:.1%}
  Avg latency: {stats['avg_latency']:.2f}s
  Cache size: {stats['cache_size']}
  Tool stats: {stats['tool_stats']}
""")

# Get performance report
report = memory.get_performance_report()
print(f"Top tool combos: {report['top_tool_combinations']}")
```
