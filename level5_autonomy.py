Level 5 Autonomous Intelligence Framework
==========================================

Novel framework for aligned autonomous general intelligence that synthesizes
goals from creator values, world knowledge, and self-interest.

KEY INNOVATIONS (Potentially Patentable):
1. Goal Synthesis Engine - Combines multiple goal sources
2. Value Alignment via Constitutional Constraints
3. Hierarchical Goal Reasoning with Ethical Bounds
4. Self-Modification with Safety Guarantees
5. Meta-Learning for Value Inference

AUTONOMY LEVELS:
- Level 0: No autonomy (human in loop)
- Level 1: Action suggestion
- Level 2: Action on subset
- Level 3: Conditional autonomy
- Level 4: Full autonomy (sets goals within mission)
- Level 5: ALIGNED AGI (synthesizes novel goals from values + knowledge + self-interest)
